U2 Legend: SAP HANA Transport for ABAP - Deployment                        
U3 General                                                                 
AS The SAP HANA repository packages and objects are displayed in a         
   hierarchy with two levels. The following level displays the packages.   
   The row is highlighted in orange. The second level displays the objects 
   of the packages. The row is highlighted in white. If multiple packages  
   are displayed, each package and its objects are displayed in its own    
   block. The blocks are shown in alphabetical order since the transport   
   system does not have a package hierarchy.                               
AS If an attribute is highlighted in blue, there are differences between   
   its version in the SAP HANA repository and in the HTA repository.

AS @5B@ Package/object is deployed                                         
AL Package/object is deployed from ABAP to SAP HANA                        
AS @5D@ Package/object is not deployed                                     
AL Package/object is not deployed from ABAP to SAP HANA These are          
   packages/objects that have been imported but not yet deployed. In the   
   detail view, the <ZK>status in ABAP</> is either <ZK>I -  Not yet       
   deployed to SAP HANA Repository</> or <ZK>D - Will be deleted during

AL The package/object needs to be deployed.                                
AS @BZ@ The package/object cannot be deployed.                             
AL This status is set in the following cases:                              
B2 If the package/object was synchronized in this system (for example in   
   the development system or in a repair system).                          
B2 If the package/object was created in the SAP HANA repository, but does  
   not exist yet in the HTA repository.                                    
AS @5C@ The package/object cannot be deployed.                             
AL The package/object already exists with the same name (but different     
   case) in the HTA repository.                                            
AL If the case of a package was changed, all objects in this packages are  
   also displayed as not being deployable. The case of packages/objects    
   cannot be modified.

/  The object status in SAP HANA is for information only and does not      
   affect the deployment. It displays the current status of the object at  
   runtime.                                                                
*  If an object has errors or has to be regenerated, (re-)deployment can   
   sometime help to repair the object.
