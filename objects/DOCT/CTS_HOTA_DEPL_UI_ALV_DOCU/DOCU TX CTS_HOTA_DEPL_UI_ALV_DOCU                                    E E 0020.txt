U2 Deploying Packages/Objects                                              
AS This table displays all package found for the specified search criteria 
   and the objects in these packages. The table displays the packages and  
   objects that currently exist in the SAP HANA repository and the packages
   and objects in the HTA repository. If a package or object does not exist
   in one of the two repositories, the associated properties are displayed 
   as <(><<)>unknown>.                                                     
U2 &WHAT_TO_DO&                                                            
N1 If necessary, check the data in the table. You can display the details  
   for a package or object by double-clicking it. The detail view shows all
   properties for which data exists in one of the repositories (SAP HANA or
   ABAP). Information hidden in the table is also displayed.               
/  A symbol at the start of each row indicates the deployment status. This 
   indicates whether the ABAP version of the data package/object is already
   active in SAP HANA (has already been deployed) or whether it can be     
   deployed. Various properties in SAP HANA and ABAP are stored in blue.   
/  A description of the symbols can be found under                         
   <DS:TX.CTS_HTA_DEPL_UI_LEGEND>Legend: SAP HANA Transport for ABAP</>.   
N1 If necessary, you can filter the table by one or more deployment        
   statuses.                                                               
/  By default, the filter is deactivated. If the filter is activated, this 
   is indicated in the header row. Next time a package is selected, the    
   filter is deactivated again.                                            
/  Note: Objects cannot be displayed without the associated package. As a  
   result, a package might be displayed which because of its status and the
   chosen filter actually should not be displayed.                         
N1 Any packages/objects that have differences and have not yet been        
   deployed to the SAP HANA repository are preselected by the system.      
/  Check the selection of packages and objects and modify it if needed.    
   Select the packages and objects that you want to deploy. You can also   
   deploy packages and objects that have already been deployed.            
/  You have the following selection options (using the pushbuttons):       
B2 Select/unselect all deployable packages/objects                         
/  Any packages and objects whose status is green or yellow can be         
   deployed.                                                               
B2 Select/unselect all in current block                                    
/  Selects or unselects the packages and objects in the currently selected 
   block.                                                                  
B2 Select packages/objects to deploy                                       
/  All packages and objects whose status is yellow have not yet been       
   deployed to the SAP HANA repository and can be deployed.                
N1 To start the deployment, choose <LS>Execute (F8)</>.                    
U2 &RESULT&                                                                
AS The versions of the selected packages/objects in the HTA repository are 
   imported to the SAP HANA repository and activated there. The system     
   indicates the result of the deployment in a message and displays the    
   deployment log.                                                         
U2 Examples:                                                               
B1 You are logged on in a target system and want to deploy an object once  
   the prework has been done. The object was created and synchronized in   
   the SAP HANA repository in the development system. Deployment status P  
   has been set for this package in the development system. (<LS>Objects   
   should be deployed only after the prework is done</>). You have imported
   the associated task in the target system. Once you done the prework and 
   have documented this, you now want to deploy the object.                
/  Note: You document the prework in table CTS_HOT_PREWORK. Create a new   
   entry and enter the ABAP transport object name of the package, which is 
   displayed in the details view of package, and PREWORK DONE = X.         
B1 Importing a request with SAP HANA repository objects was not successful.
   If the import error was not caused by the object itself, rather by      
   another object or by incorrect or missing settings in SAP HANA (missing 
   schema mapping or authorizations for example), you can now repeat the   
   deplyoment without transporting the object again. If the import error   
   can only be removed by changing the object, you need to change,         
   re-synchronize and transport the object in the development system.      
B1 In the case of objects whose <LS>object status in SAP HANA</> is either 
   <LS>error</> or <LS>must be regenerated</>, (re-)deployment can         
   sometimes help to repair SAP HANA runtime objects.

B1 By choosing <LS>Utilities -> Version Management</>, you can display HTA 
   version management for individual packages or objects. You must set the 
   cursor on a package or object row before you can display version        
   management.                                                             
B1 By choosing <LS>Goto -> Synchronization</>, you can call transaction    
   SCTS_HTA (<LS>SAP HANA Transport for ABAP - Synchronization</>).
