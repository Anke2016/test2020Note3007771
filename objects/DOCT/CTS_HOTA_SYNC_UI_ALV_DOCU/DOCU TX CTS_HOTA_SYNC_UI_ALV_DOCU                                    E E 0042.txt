U2 Synchronizing Packages/Objects                                          
AS This table displays all package found for the specified search criteria 
   and the objects in these packages. The table displays the packages and  
   objects that currently exist in the SAP HANA repository and the packages
   and objects in the HTA repository. If a package or object does not exist
   in one of the two repositories, the associated properties are displayed 
   as <(><<)>unknown>.                                                     
U2 &WHAT_TO_DO&                                                            
N1 If necessary, check the data in the table. You can display the details  
   for a package or object by double-clicking it. The detail view shows all
   properties for which data exists in one of the repositories (SAP HANA or
   ABAP). Information hidden in the table is also displayed.               
/  A symbol at the start of each row indicates the synchronization status. 
   This specifies whether the package/object is the same in SAP HANA and   
   ABAP or whether there are differences, and the package/object needs to  
   be synchronized (from SAP HANA to ABAP). Properties that do not match   
   are highlighted in blue.                                                
/  A description of the symbols can be found under

   Synchronization</>.                                                     
N1 If necessary, you can filter the table by one or more synchronization   
   statuses.                                                               
/  By default, the filter is deactivated. If the filter is activated, this 
   is indicated in the header row. Next time a package is selected, the    
   filter is deactivated again.                                            
/  Note: Objects cannot be displayed without the associated package. As a  
   result, a package might be displayed which because of its status and the
   chosen filter actually should not be displayed.                         
N1 Any packages/objects that have differences and need to be synchronized  
   are preselected by the system.                                          
/  Check the selection of packages and objects and modify it if needed.    
   Select the packages that you want to synchronize. You can also          
   synchronize packages and objects that are already synchronized.         
/  You have the following selection options (using the pushbuttons):       
B2 Select/unselect all synchronizable packages/objects                     
/  Any packages and objects can be synchronized whose status is green or   
   yellow.                                                                 
B2 Select/unselect all in current block                                    
/  Selects or unselects the packages and objects in the currently selected 
   block.                                                                  
B2 Select packages/objects to synchronize                                  
/  Synchronize all packages and objects whose status is yellow.            
N1 To start the synchronization, choose <LS>Execute (F8)</>.               
N1 Select a transport request to which the objects are assigned or create a
   new transport request.                                                  
N1 If a package is being synchronized for the first time, you are prompted 
   assign it to an ABAP package. Specify an ABAP package.                  
/  Note: We recommend that you assign all associated SAP HANA packages to  
   the same ABAP package. Assign them to the ABAP package whose objects are
   transported together with the SAP HAND objects.                         
U2 &RESULT&                                                                
AS The current active versions of the selected packages/objects are read   
   from the SAP HANA repository and passed to the HTA repository. The      
   system produces the result of the synchronization in a message.         
/  Either subobjects of the package (LIMU HOTO) or its meta data (LIMU     
   HOTP) are added to the transport request depending on whether individual
   objects or packages are being synchronized. If a package is synchronized
   with all its objects, it is added to the transport request as a full    
   object (R3TR HOTA).                                                     
/  The following applies to packages that have never been synchronized: If 
   only one part of the objects of the package was selected for            
   synchronization, and not the package itself, the objects are added to   
   the transport request as LIMU HOTO and the package is added as LIMU     
   HOTP. If all objects of the packages were selected, and not the package 
   itself, the packages is added to the transport request as a full object 
   R3TR HOTA.                                                              
/  You can release the transport request in Transport Organizer            
   (transaction SE09) and import it in the target system.

B1 You are logged on to the development system. You have created a new     
   object in the SAP HANA repository and you want to include this object in
   a request for the first time. All properties that affect the HTA        
   repository are set to <(><<)>unknown> for this object.                  
B1 You are logged on to the development system. You have deleted an object 
   in the SAP HANA repository and you want to transport this deletion.  If 
   this deleted object is known in the HTA repository (since it was already
   synchronized), the properties that affect the SAP HANA repository are   
   set to <(><<)>unknown>.                                                 
B1 You are logged on in a system in which HTA objects are being imported.  
   The import is performed in two steps, the main import and the SAP HANA  
   repository deployment, which means that the SAP HANA properties are set 
   to <(><<)>unknown> if the main import was already performed but not the 
   deployment.                                                             
U2 Additional Functions                                                    
B1 By choosing <ZK>Utilities -> Set Deploy Mode</>, you can specify whether
   each selected package and its objects are deployed to the SAP HANA      
   repository immediately when it is imported into a follow-on system.     
   First select the packages in question.                                  
/  When imported, the packages and their objects are deployed immediately  
   to the SAP HANA repository by default.                                  
B1 By choosing <ZK>Utilities -> Define Translation Relevance</>, you can   
   specify whether the texts in the objects in each selected package are   
   translation-relevant. First select the packages in question.            
/  Translation-relevance is activated by default. In this case, HTA        
   synchronizes the texts of the objects in the SAP HANA package in the    
   original language of the SAP HANA package. These texts can then be      
   translated using the regular ABAP translation tool (transaction SE63).  
   Note that HTA and the translation tool only support those languages     
   activated in the ABAP system. If a localized language not currently     
   activated in ABAP is used as the original language of the SAP HANA      
   package, the language is set to the main language in ABAP (for example, 
   en_US in SAP HANA becomes EN in ABAP). For more information about       
   activating language, see SAP Note 42305.                                
/  Caution: If translation-relevance is deactivated, any existing          
   translations are deleted and cannot be restored by activating transla   
=  tion-relevance again later.                                             
B1 By choosing <ZK>Utilities -> Version Management</>, you can display HTA 
   version management for individual packages or objects. You must set the 
   cursor on a package or object row before you can display version        
   management.
