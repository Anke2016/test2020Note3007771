*  Deployment of SAP HANA packages and objects generally takes place       
   automatically after a transport request has beeen imported into the     
   system. If this doesn't happen, you can activate the SAP HANA packages  
   and objects in the target system subsequently. This can be necessary for
   example if the settings in SAP HANA stipulate that a package cannot be  
   deployed until the prework has been done (deploy mode P). It might be   
   necessary to redeploy because of errors in other objects or missing     
   settings in SAP HANA.
