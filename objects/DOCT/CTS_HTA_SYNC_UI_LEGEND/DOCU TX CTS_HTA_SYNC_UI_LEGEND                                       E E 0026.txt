U2 Legend: SAP HANA Transport for ABAP - Synchronization                   
U3 General                                                                 
AS The SAP HANA repository packages and objects are displayed in a         
   hierarchy with two levels. The following level displays the packages.   
   The row is highlighted in orange. The second level displays the objects 
   of the packages. The row is highlighted in white. If multiple packages  
   are displayed, each package and its objects are displayed in its own    
   block. The blocks are shown in alphabetical order since the transport   
   system does not have a package hierarchy.                               
AS If an attribute is highlighted in blue, there are differences between   
   its version in the SAP HANA repository and in the HTA repository.       
/  <ZH>Note</>: The standard view in the table does not show all           
   properties, but an icon can indicate a difference without any of the    
   visible properties being highlighted. In this case, one of the hidden   
   properties is different. You can display the detail view in order to    
   view the different properties. Alternatively, you can modify your layout
   to include the differences in the overview.                             
U3 Icons for the Synchronization Status                                    
AS @5B@ Package/object is in sync                                          
AL The package/object is the same in HANA and ABAP.                        
AS @5D@ Package/object is not in sync                                      
AL The package/object is different in HANA and ABAP. The package/object    
   needs to be synchronized.                                               
AS @BZ@ The package/object cannot be synchronized.                         
AL This can occur if the package/object was imported in this system but not
   yet deployed to SAP HANA. In the detail view, the <ZK>status in ABAP</> 
   is either <ZK>I -  Not yet deployed to SAP HANA Repository</> or <ZK>D -
   Will be deleted during deployment</>                                    
AL The package/object cannot be synchronized until after deployment.       
   Caution: The deployment overwrites a previous change in SAP HANA r      
=  epository. Make the change again after deployment and then synchronize. 
AS @5C@ The package/object cannot be synchronized.                         
AL The package/object already exists with the same name (but different     
   case) in the HTA repository.                                            
AL If the case of a package was changed, all objects in this packages are  
   also displayed as not being synchronizable. The case of packages/objects
   cannot be modified.                                                     
U3 Icons for the Object Status in SAP HANA                                 
AS @01@ The object is OK                                                   
AL The object can be executed in the system.                               
AS @AG@ The object has errors                                              
AL The object cannot be executed in the system at present.                 
AS @39@ The object must be generated again.                                
AL The object cannot be executed in the system at present.                 
*  <ZH>Note</>: Object status icons are only shown in SAP HANA if at least 
   one object was found with an error or an object that needs to be genera 
=  ted again.                                                              
/  The object status in SAP HANA is for information only and does not      
   affect the synchronization. It displays the current status of the object
   at runtime. For synchronization on the other hand, the active version of
   the object in the development system is used at design time. This means 
   that an object can be synchronized and transported even if it cannot be 
   executed in SAP HANA at runtime (due to an error). It may be the case,  
   for example, that an object referenced by this object in the development
   system was modified in such a way that it now has an error. In the      
   target system, however, the referenced object may still have an older   
   version on which the object in question can be executed without errors. 
   For this reason, the objects are always synchronized independently of   
   the object status in SAP HANA.
