AS You can use the <ZH>SAP HANA Transport for ABAP</> (HTA) to transport   
   objects from ABAP for SAP HANA applications. These are ABAP applications
   based on SAP HANA and for which ABAP objects and SAP HANA objects are   
   transported using Change and Transport System in ABAP.                  
/  Firstly, you have to transfer objects and packages from the SAP HANA    
   repository to the SAP HANA Transport for ABAP repository (HTA r         
=  epository) in the ABAP system and add them to a transport request. This 
   action is known as "synchronization".                                   
/  Once released, the transport request can be imported using Transport    
   Management System in the target system. The packages and objects in are 
   created and activated in the SAP HANA repository when imported. This    
   action is known as "deployment".                                        
/  In this way, you can transport even minor changes to SAP HANA objects   
   and packages.
