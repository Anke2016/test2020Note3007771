AS The specified object was not part of the object set of the objects to be
   activated in this attempt. Despite this, it was registered as the result
   of the activation by the SAP HANA repository.                           
AS This can occur in the following cases:                                  
B1 The SAP HAND repository included the object in question in the list of  
   objects to activate implicitly. This is the case when the object in     
   question is both dependent on an object to be activated and is itself   
   used by an object to be activated.                                      
/  Example: A has a dependency on B and B has a dependency on C. If both A 
   and C are activated, B is added to the activation implicitly.           
B1 The object in question is an activation plug-in in the SAP HAND         
   repository and an error occurred when objects were activated that were  
   scheduled to be activated by this plug-in.

AS If the import ended successfully, no action is required.                
AS If the import was not successful, analyze the previous errors in this   
   log and correct them.
