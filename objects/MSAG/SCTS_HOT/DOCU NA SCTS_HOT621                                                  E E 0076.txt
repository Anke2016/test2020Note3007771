U1 &SYSTEM_RESPONSE&                                                       
AS When starting to deploy SAP HANA objects, the system identified that HDI
   objects and/or SAP HANA Repository packages/objects with deployment     
   errors already existed in the HTA Repository before the deployment, but 
   these packages/objects were not part of the deployment.                 
AS SAP HANA objects are deployed in the following cases:                   
B1 When transporting HDI objects/SAP HANA Repository packages/objects in   
   the import step <ZK>SAP HANA Deployment</>                              
B1 When using Note Assistant (transaction SNOTE) to import corrections to  
   HDI objects/SAP HANA Repository packages/objects                        
B1 In manual deployments of HDI objects in the transaction SCTS_HDI_DEPLOY 
AS These HDI objects/SAP HANA packages/objects with errors may have        
   possibly been deployable after the deployment, which is why the system  
   attempted to deploy them. As a result, the system scheduled a job named 
   REDEPLOY_FAILED_HANA_OBJECTS.                                           
AS The job attempts the following:                                         
B1 It tries to deploy all HDI objects that have status <LS>E - Deployment  
   to container failed</> or <LS>Z - Deletion in container failed</> in the
   HTA Repository in the system to the HDI containers.                     
B1 It tries to deploy all SAP HANA packages/objects that have the status   
   <LS>E - Deployment to SAP HANA Repository failed</> or <LS>Deletion in  
   SAP HANA Repository failed</> in the system HTA Repository to the SAP   
   HANA Repository.                                                        
AS This means it is possible to only correct and transport the HDI         
   objects/SAP HANA packages/objects that actually contain errors, because 
   all dependent HDI objects/SAP HANA packages/objects containing errors   
   are automatically deployed again after the import and are error-free if 
   the deployment is successful.                                           
AS The current status of HDI objects can be viewed in the transaction      
   SCTS_HDI_DEPLOY.                                                        
/  The current status of SAP HANA packages/objects in the HTA Repository   
   can be viewed in transaction SCTS_HTA_DEPLOY in the package/object      
   details.                                                                
U1 &SYS_ADMIN&                                                             
AS The job is scheduled by default if packages/objects/HDI objects with    
   deployment errors existed in the HTA Repository before the deployment   
   but they were not part of the deployment.                               
AS The automatic scheduling of the job can be controlled using HTA         
   parameter RUN_JOB_REDEPLOY_FAILED_HANA_OBJECTS. If the entry does not   
   exist in table CTS_HOT_PARAMS or has the value X, the job is            
   automatically scheduled after the deployment. This job is also scheduled
   automatically for the following values:                                 
B1 For the value H (but only if HDI objects with errors exist)             
B1 For the value R (but only if SAP HANA Repository objects with errors    
   exist)                                                                  
AS For all other values, the job is not automatically scheduled. The job is
   only scheduled, however, for the object type (HDI and/or SAP HANA       
   Repository) for which objects were also deployed.                       
AS Alternatively you can schedule the job manually and only have the job   
   run at specific times, for example. To do this, schedule a job for      
   report SCTS_HTA_REDEPLOY_FAILED .                                       
AS It is also possible to start report SCTS_HTA_REDEPLOY_FAILED manually in
   transaction SA38.                                                       
AS If the job was scheduled by the import step <ZK>SAP HANA deployment</>  
   when transporting SAP HANA objects, the log of the redeployment job is  
   found in the step <ZK>Redeployment of HANA objects with errors</> (this 
   step is not specific to a transport request).                           
AS In all cases, it can also be found in the subdirectory <LS>log</> of the
   transport directory. Its name is <LS>5<(><<)>yymmdd>.<(><<)>SID></>.    
AS Example: If the redeployment was started on January 22, 2016, the log is
   found under <LS>/usr/sap/trans/log/5160122.QAS</>.                      
AS To display the log, start report RSPUTPRT in transaction SA38. For the  
   field <LS>Full File Name (with Dir.)</>, enter the value of the complete
   file name, for example: <LS>/usr/sap/trans/log/5160122.QAS</>.          
AS The number of activation attempts for SAP HANA Repository objects when  
   redeploying SAP HANA objects with errors can be changed using the HTA   
   parameter MAX_NO_ACTIVATION_ATTEMPTS_REDEPL_FAILED in the table         
   CTS_HOT_PARAMS.                                                         
AS For information about the process of activating SAP HANA Repository     
   objects, see the <DS:NA.SCTS_HOT539>long text of the message for the    
   individual activation attempts</>.
