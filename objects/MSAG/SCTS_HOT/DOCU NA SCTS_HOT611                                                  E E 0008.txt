AS The system deleted &V1& objects that previously only existed as inactive
   objects in the SAP HANA repository. This means that an additional active
   deletion is not necessary. The objects deleted inactively were already  
   displayed under "Object Import Details" in "The following objects were  
   deleted inactively (activation not required):".
