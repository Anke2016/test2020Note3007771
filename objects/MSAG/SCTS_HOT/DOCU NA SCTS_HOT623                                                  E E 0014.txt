AS Time that is required to lock all packages/objects to be deployed. If   
   this value is high (for example, higher than 60 seconds), this indicates
   that deployment had to wait until the deployment already running was    
   finished.                                                               
U1 &SYS_ADMIN&                                                             
AS If the situation frequently occurs that it takes significantly longer   
   than 60 seconds to lock HOTA objects, you should first check if import  
   step <ZK>SAP HANA Repository Deployment</> or the                       
   transport-request-independent step <ZK>Redeployment of SAP HANA         
   Repository Objects with errors</> was executed at the time of the       
   deployment. There are several ways to check this, for example           
   transaction STMS in the import history.                                 
B1 If the parallel deployment was the import step <ZK>SAP HANA Repository  
   Deployment</>, then check the frequency of the imports and reduce or    
   import multiple requests if required.                                   
B1 If the parallel deployment was the transport-request-independent step   
   <ZK>Redeployment of HANA Objects with errors</>, then you might have a  
   lot of SAP HANA repository objects containing errors in this system,    
   which need to be corrected. Alternatively you can prevent the execution 
   of transport-independent step <ZK>Redeployment HANA Objects with errors 
=  </> or reduce the maximum number of activation attempts for object      
   activation. For more details on this topic, see <DS:NA.SCTS_HOT621>Long 
   text of message for redeployment of SAP HANA Repository objects with    
   errors</>.
