AS After the SAP HANA repository activation, the SAP HANA repository checks
   which repository objects have dependencies on the objects just activated
   and attempts to generate these objects again.                           
AS The object specified above could not be generated again. This can be the
   case, for example, when the object with the generation error has not yet
   been synchronized with a change made to a referenced repository object. 
   For more information about the generation error, see the next lines for 
   this object in the log.                                                 
AS Note: The object specified above was not part of the import set in the  
   <ZK>SAP HANA Repository Deployment </> step.                            
AS CTS cannot indicate which object caused the generation error.

AS If the information from the log is not sufficient to resolve the error, 
   open the object above in the SAP HANA content development environment   
   (for example, SAP HANA Studio or Web IDE). Check the object for errors  
   in any references to activated objects. Level 4 of the log shows you all
   objects activated successfully.                                         
AS To remove the error, modify the object above or the referenced object.  
AS Note: If the object above was not developed in your company, contact the
   content vendor.
