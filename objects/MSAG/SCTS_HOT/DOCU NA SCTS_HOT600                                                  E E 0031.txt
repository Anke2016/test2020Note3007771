AS Check the log for import/activation errors for the objects specified at

AS The log might not contain the reason for this import/activation error.  
   This can be the case if this request contains only text elements        
   (transport objects with the type LANG HOTA or LANG HOTO) for the objects
   in question and one of the following cases also applies:                
B1 The request was imported together with at least one other request that  
   contains the object in question as a full object R3TR HOTA or a         
   subobject LIMU HOTO.                                                    
B1 There was an error in a previous import of a request that contains the  
   object in question as a full object R3TR HOTA or as a subobject LIMU    
   HOTO.                                                                   
*  In these cases, check the log of the other request for import/activation
   errors in the object in question.
