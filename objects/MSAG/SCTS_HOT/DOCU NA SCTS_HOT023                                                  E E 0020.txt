AS The texts of the SAP HANA repository objects can only be translated     
   using the standard ABAP translation tools in the ABAP system if the     
   original language in the SAP HANA repository can be converted to a      
   language activated in ABAP.                                             
AS The following options are available to you:                             
B1 If the language exists in the ABAP system but is inactive, activate the 
   language. For more information about activating languages in ABAP       
   systems, see SAP Note 42305.                                            
B1 If the language is not supported at all in the ABAP system, change the  
   original language of the package in the SAP HANA repository: To do this,
   go to SAP HANA Studio, for example, and switch to the perspective <LS>  
=  SAP HANA Modeler</>. Choose <LS>Window -> Show View -> Properties</> to 
   view and modify the properties of the package. If the original language 
   cannot be changed here, use the perspective <LS>SAP HANA Development</>.
   In <LS>Project Explorer</>, choose <LS>Team -> Edit Package</> from the 
   context menu in the package node of the project in question. Then       
   restart the synchronization.
