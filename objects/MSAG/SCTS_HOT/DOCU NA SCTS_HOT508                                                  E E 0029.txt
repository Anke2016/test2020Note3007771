AS SAP HANA repository objects are deployed in three steps:                
N1 All objects in the transports imported together are written to the SAP  
   HANA repository individually as inactive objects. Any deleted objects   
   are deleted inactively in the SAP HANA repository.                      
N1 All objects in the transports imported together that were written or    
   deleted as inactive objects are passed to the SAP HANA repository for   
   activation in a single call.                                            
AL If any activation errors occur, the activation is performed in multiple 
   attempts. For more information, <DS:NA.SCTS_HOT539>see the long text of 
   the message for the individual activation attempts</>.                  
N1 For all activated objects of the imported transport objects R3TR HOTA   
   and LIMU HOTO, the existing texts are deployed in all languages for     
   which texts exist in the HTA repository. For the transport objects 'LANG
   HOTO <(><<)>object name> <(><<)>language>' and 'LANG HOTA <(><<)>package
   name> <(><<)>language>', only the texts in the specified languages are  
   deployed.
