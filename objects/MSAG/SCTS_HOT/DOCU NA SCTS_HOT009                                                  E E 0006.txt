B1 If the status of the package is 'A', this package is already active. If 
   you still want to deploy the object again, import the associated        
   transport request again.                                                
B1 If the status of the package is 'N', the package was modified in this   
   system and must not be overwritten by a deployment. If you want to      
   discard the local change, import a transport request with the required  
   package version.
