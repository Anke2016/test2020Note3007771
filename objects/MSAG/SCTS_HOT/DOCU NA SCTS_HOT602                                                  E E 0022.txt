AS No texts to deploy were found in the HTA repository for the specified   
   objects. This can occur in the following cases:                         
B1 The package of the object is set to 'non-translation-relevant'. In      
   transaction SCTS_HTA, you can view this for the package in question by  
   displaying the details of the package.                                  
B1 The texts were deployed earlier.                                        
B1 No text parts were imported for the transport objects R3TR HOTA or LIMU 
   HOTO.                                                                   
B1 No texts were found for the transport objects 'LANG HOTO <(><<)>object  
   name> <(><<)>language>' or 'LANG HOTA <(><<)>package name> <(>          
=  <<)>language>' . This can be due to the following reasons:              
B2 a) The transport object with type LANG was imported using a delivery    
   request (such as a support package or upgrade package) and the          
   associated language was not active in the system. This means that the   
   associated texts in other languages were not imported into the HTA      
   repository during the main import.                                      
B2 There were no texts for the language key in the export (see the export  
   log), since either the wrong language key was specified or the texts    
   were deleted deliberately at an earlier point in time.
