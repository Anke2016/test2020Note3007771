AS The system checks whether any HDI objects and/or SAP HANA Repository    
   packages/objects with deployment errors (and that were not part of the  
   deployment) existed in the HTA Repository before the deployment of SAP  
   HANA objects. If, after the deployment, any HDI objects and/or SAP HANA 
   Repository packages/objects with errors exist, the system checks whether
   it can use the job REDPLOY_FAILED_HANA_OBJECTS to deploy these          
   objects/packages retroactively. Whether this can happen depends on the  
   configuration of the system.                                            
AS The next line in the log is a message indicating whether a redeployment 
   is scheduled and for which HANA object type (HDI and SAP HANA           
   Repository).

   and the configuration of the redeployment job, see the long text for the
   message <DS:NA.SCTS_HOT621>Redeployment of SAP HANA objects with errors
