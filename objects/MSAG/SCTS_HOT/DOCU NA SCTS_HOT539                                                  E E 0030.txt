AS In the first attempt all objects in the transports imported together    
   that were written or deleted as inactive objects are passed to the HANA 
   repository for activation in a call.                                    
AS With all further attempts those objects that could not yet be activated 
   and which were not yet logged with an error in a previous attempt are   
   passed.                                                                 
U2 General information about the process of activation                     
AS Activation in the SAP HANA repository is only successful if all passed  
   objects could be activated. As long as even one object has an error,    
   none of the passed objects can be activated.                            
AS The aim of HTA deployment in the <LS>object activation</> step is to    
   activate as many objects as possible. So HTA attempts to ascertain the  
   set of objects that can be activated in one call. For this reason, and  
   if necessary, the objects are activated in multiple retries.            
AS First, HTA tries to activate all objects at the same time. If this      
   activation is successful, deployment is complete and all objects and    
   requests are set successfully. If this activation is not successful, a  
   second attempt is started with all objects that would have been         
   successful in the first attempt.                                        
AS The system keeps trying to activate the objects until no more objects   
   are available for activation, and either a <ZK>success</> or <ZK>error  
=  </> message was issued for each object. Objects and requests are logged 
   as <LS>successful</> or <LS>erroneous</>. Activation is stopped once the
   maximum number of attempts is reached. In this case, all objects that   
   are not yet activated together with their requests are logged as <LS>   
=  erroneous</>.                                                           
AS For each attempt, the log contains a separate section specifying the    
   objects in the order processed as calculated by the SAP HANA repository.
   If errors occur, an error message is specified for the objects in       
   question. For objects without errors, a reference to the next attempt is
   specified. If the log is expanded, it also contains any messages and log
   messages (check results) that come from the SAP HANA repository.
