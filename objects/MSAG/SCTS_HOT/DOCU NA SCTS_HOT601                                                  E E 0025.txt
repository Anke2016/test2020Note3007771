AS No texts were deployed for one or more objects. This can occur in the   
   following cases:                                                        
B1 No texts to deploy exist for the object in the system. This can be due  
   to the following reasons:                                               
B2 The package of the object is set to 'non-translation-relevant'. In      
   transaction SCTS_HTA, you can view this for the package in question by  
   displaying the details of the package.                                  
B2 The texts were deployed earlier.                                        
B2 No text parts were imported for the transport objects 'R3TR HOTA' or    
   'LIMU HOTO'.                                                            
B2 No texts were found for the transport objects 'LANG HOTO <(><<)>object  
   name> <(><<)>language>' or 'LANG HOTA <(><<)>package name> <(>          
=  <<)>language>' . This can be due to the following reasons:              
BL a) The transport object with type LANG was imported using a delivery    
   request (such as a support package) and the associated language was not 
   active in the system. This means that the associated texts in other     
   languages were not imported into the HTA repository during the main     
   import.                                                                 
BL b) There were no texts for the language key in the export (see the      
   export log), since either the wrong language key was specified or the   
   texts were deleted deliberately at an earlier point in time.            
B1 No text deployment is required, since the object was deleted during the 
   activation.
