AS After the SAP HANA repository activation, the SAP HANA repository checks
   which repository objects have dependencies on the objects just activated
   and attempts to generate these objects again.                           
AS The object specified above could not be generated again. This can be the
   case, for example, when the object with the generation error has not yet
   been synchronized with a change made to a referenced repository object. 
AS The object specified above was part of the <ZK>SAP HANA Repository      
   Deployment</> step, but could not be imported into the SAP HANA         
   repository or it could not be activated. This information is included in
   the import/activation errors in the log.                                
AS Note: The object was generated using the object version that was active 
   before the <ZK>SAP HANA Repository Deployment</> step in the SAP HANA   
   repository. This is why you must remove the import error or activation  
   error and not the generated error specified here.                       
AS CTS cannot indicate which object caused the generation error.

AS In the development system, remove the import error or activation error  
   indicated under the object above in the log. Then transport the object  
   again.

   content vendor.
