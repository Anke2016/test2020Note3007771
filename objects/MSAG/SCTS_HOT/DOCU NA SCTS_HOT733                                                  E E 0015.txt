*  The system detected that SAP HANA objects (HDI objects and/or SAP HANA  
   Repository packages/objects) with errors are in the system after the    
   deployment and that these packages/objects had errors before the        
   deployment.                                                             
*  By default, SAP HANA objects with errors like these are redeployed using
   the job REDEPLOY_FAILED_HANA_OBJECTS. Automatic scheduling of this job, 
   however, is disabled in this system by configuration.

*  You can deploy the SAP HANA objects with errors manually. To do this,   
   start the program SCTS_HTA_REDEPLOY_FAILED manually in transaction SA38.
