B1 If the status of the object is 'A', this object is already active. If   
   you still want to deploy the object again, import the associated        
   transport request again.                                                
B1 If the status of the object is 'N', the object was modified in this     
   system and must not be overwritten by a deployment. If you want to      
   discard the local change, import a transport request with the required  
   object version.
