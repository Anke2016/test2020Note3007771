AS The system detected that &V1& occurred in the workbench activation of   
   SAP HANA Transport for ABAP (HTA) objects.                              
*  The activation log was saved to the transport log directory &V2& in the 
   file with the name &V3&.                                                
AS

*  Confirm this dialog box to display the activation log.                  
*  You can display the log again later using the report RSPUTPRT.          
*  To do this, start the report RSPUTPRT using transaction SA38 and enter  
   the full file name in the field "Full File Name (with Dir.)". This name 
   is created from the name of the transport log directory &V2& and the    
   file name &V3&.

*  To start the workbench activation of the non-activated HTA objects      
   again, use the report SCTS_HTA_WB_ACTIVATION.
