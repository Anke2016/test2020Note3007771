AS After the SAP HANA repository activation, the SAP HANA repository checks
   which repository objects have dependencies on the objects just activated
   and attempts to generate these objects again.                           
AS The object specified above could not be generated again. This can be the
   case, for example, when the object with the generation error has not yet
   been synchronized with a change made to a referenced repository object. 
AS The object specified above was part of the SAP HANA Repository          
   Deployment step, and was successfully activated in a previous attempt.  
   This means that the version of the object that was already activated was
   regenerated.                                                            
AS CTS cannot indicate which object caused the generation error.           
U1 &WHAT_TO_DO&                                                            
AS First of all, check if the object still has an error. To do this, start 
   transaction SCTS_HTA and display all objects contained in the package of
   the object specified above. Then display the details of the object      
   specified above:                                                        
B1 If the <LS>object status in HANA</> is displayed as <LS>Object is OK</>,
   the object has already been successfully regenerated or activated, for  
   example, when a new transport request was imported.                     
B1 If the <LS>object status in HANA</> is not displayed as <LS>Object is OK
=  </>, correct the error, which you find in the log beneath the object    
   specified above, in the development system. Then transport the object   
   again.                                                                  
AS Note: If the object above was not developed in your company, contact the
   content vendor.
