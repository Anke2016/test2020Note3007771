AS The package &V1&&V2&&V3& cannot be synchronized in its current status ( 
=  &V4&).

AS The package was previously only imported into the HTA repository but not
   deployed there.

AS Deploy the package before you synchronize it, for example by            
   transporting or importing the package again.
