AS If you want to export transport requests in this system that contain    
   objects with the type R3TR HOTA, LIMU HOTO, LIMU HOTP, LANG HOTA, or    
   LANG HOTO, first update the transport tools, Otherwise errors can occur 
   in imports.                                                             
/  You can resume the synchronization of SAP HANA packages and objects.    
   Make sure, however, the transport tools are updated before the transport
   request is released (before the export).
