AS The object above could not be activated. You find more information about
   the import errors or activation errors in the next lines in the log.    
AS If the object in question is an SAP object, its SAP application         
   component is displayed in square brackets. You can use these to find    
   existing SAP Notes or open a problem message.                           
U1 &WHAT_TO_DO&                                                            
AS If the information from the log is not sufficient to resolve the error, 
   open the object above in the SAP HANA content development environment   
   (for example, SAP HANA Studio or Web IDE). Check it for errors. Note    
   that non-activated objects are created as inactive objects under the    
   user SAP<(><<)>SID> .                                                   
AS To display the object, you have the following options:                  
B1 Log on to the SAP HANA content development environment with the database
   user SAP<(><<)>SID>.                                                    
B1 Log on to the SAP HANA content development environment with your user   
   and transfer the inactive objects from the SAP<(><<)>SID> user to your  
   user (for example using the <LS>Switch Ownership</> function in SAP HANA
   Studio).                                                                
AS The object itself may potentially have errors or prerequisites may not  
   be met. If the object itself has errors, remove the error in the source 
   system and transport the object again. Otherwise meet the missing       
   prerequisites.                                                          
AS You can also use SAP Note 2109690 to analyze activation errors.         
AS Note: If the object above was not developed in your company, contact the
   content vendor.
