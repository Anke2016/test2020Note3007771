AS One or more objects were not deployed because the last action in this   
   system for these objects was a synchronization of the SAP HANA          
   repository to the HTA repository. Due to this synchronization, the      
   system assumes that the most up-to-date version for these objects is in 
   the SAP HANA repository and should not be overwritten there.
