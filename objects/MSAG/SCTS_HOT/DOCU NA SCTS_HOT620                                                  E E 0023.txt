AS A deployment is already running for the SAP HANA package with the ABAP  
   transport object name &V1& and/or at least one of its objects.          
U1 &WHAT_TO_DO&                                                            
AS Restart the deployment later.                                           
AS Before you restart the deployment later on, you should check if the     
   package or the objects, which you want to deploy, have already been     
   deployed in the meantime.                                               
AS You can do this by using transaction SCTS_HTA_DEPLOY. If the            
   package/object with the green status is displayed as <ZK>Package/object 
   is deployed</>, you do not need to deploy it again. If the              
   package/object with the yellow status is displayed as <ZK>package/object
   is not deployed</>, this means that the version in the HTA Repository   
   has not been deployed to the SAP HANA Repository and you can start a    
   deployment.
