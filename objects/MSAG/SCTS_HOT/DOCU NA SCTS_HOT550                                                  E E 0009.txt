AS One or more objects were not deployed since they were already deployed. 
   This can occur in the following cases:                                  
B1 An object is to be deleted but does not exist in the SAP HANA           
   repository. This can be the case when an object that has not yet been   
   imported is imported as a deletion first. Another case is when an object
   is added to request 1, deleted in request 2, and both requests are      
   imported at the same time.                                              
B1 The system is configured with REPEATONERROR=8, which means that only    
   objects with errors are imported when an import is retried.             
B1 The object in question is deployed manually between the main import and 
   the SAP HANA repository deployment.
