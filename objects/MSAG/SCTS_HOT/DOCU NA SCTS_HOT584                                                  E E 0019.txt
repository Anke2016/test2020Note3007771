N1 If you want to use the functions in the non-deployed packages, perform  
   the prework in question. Contact your software provider to find out     
   which prework is required.                                              
N1 After you have done the prework, repeat the import (if the packages in  
   question were not already deployed in the prework). To find out whether 
   the packages in question were deployed in the prework, call transaction 
   SCTS_HTA and display the packages. These are the packages with the entry
   'Prework missing' in the log.                                           
B2 If the status of the packages is green (@5B@ - 'Package/object is in    
   sync'), the packages were already deployed to the SAP HANA repository.  
   You do not need to repeat the import.                                   
B2 If the status is gray (@BZ@ - 'Package/object cannot be synchronized'), 
   the packages were not yet deployed to the SAP HANA repository. In the   
   detailed view of a package like this, 'Status in ABAP' contains the     
   information 'I (inactive) - Not yet deployed to SAP HANA Repository'.   
   Import the transport request with the non-deployed packages again.
