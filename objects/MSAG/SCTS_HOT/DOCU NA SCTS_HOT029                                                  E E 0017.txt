U1 &CAUSE&                                                                 
AS You have set the deploy mode to A (default) and hence changed the       
   associated SAP HANA package attribute in the HTA repository. This means 
   that only the package attribute is changed in the HTA repository after  
   the import and no automatic object deployment is started. If you want   
   the objects in the package to be deployed when they are imported, you   
   must make sure the objects are part of the transport request (or are at 
   least in the import queue later).                                       
AS We recommend that you synchronize the objects of the selected packages  
   so that they are placed in the transport request and the same transport 
   request as before is used.
