AS The original language was not specified when the package was created in 
   the SAP HANA repository.                                                
AS In ABAP, however, an original language must exist in the object         
   directory entry (TADIR) for the package in question in the HTA repos    
=  itory. When you confirm the dialog field, the system assigns your       
   current logon language to the package as its original language in ABAP  
   (in the object directory entry). Note that, in this case, the original  
   language is set in ABAP only and not in the SAP HANA repository.        
AS The following options are available to you:                             
B1 If the package contains objects relevant for translation, you must first
   cancel the action for consistency reasons and specify the original      
   language for this package in the SAP HANA repository. To do this, go to 
   SAP HANA Studio, for example, and switch to the perspective <LS>SAP HANA
   Modeler</>. Choose <LS>Window -> Show View -> Properties</> to view and 
   modify the properties of the package. If the original language cannot be
   changed here, use the perspective <LS>SAP HANA Development</>. In <LS>  
=  Project Explorer</>, choose <LS>Team -> Edit Package</> from the context
   menu in the package node of the project in question.                    
AL Then restart the synchronization.                                       
B1 If the package does not contain any objects relevant for translation,   
   you do not need to specify the original language in the SAP HANA        
   repository. You can use the current ABAP logon language as the ABAP     
   original language of the package and resume the synchronization by      
   choosing <LS>Yes</>.                                                    
/  Do not forget, however, that you may want to write texts in the SAP HANA
   repository at a later point in time and the ABAP original language must 
   then match this language.
