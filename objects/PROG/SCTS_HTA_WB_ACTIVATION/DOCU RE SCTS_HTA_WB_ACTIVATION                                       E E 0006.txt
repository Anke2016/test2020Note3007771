AS When note corrections for objects in ABAP for SAP HANA applications are 
   implemented, it may not be possible to activate the following object    
   types:                                                                  
B1 SAP HANA repository objects and packages                                
B1 HDI objects                                                             
AS If this is the case, these objects must be activated again once the     
   cause of the error is removed.                                          
AS You can use this program to do this.

AS The program performs the workbench activation for non-activated objects 
   of the user who is logged on to the system. Make sure that the user     
   executing the program is the same user who is implementing the note.

AS If it was possible to activate inactive objects, a success message      
   appears.                                                                
AS If the objects could not be activated, the system displays the error    
   message <DS:NA.SCTS_HOT588>Error in the HTA WB activation; see the log  
=  </>. View the log for troubleshooting.                                  
AS Note: If inactive SAP HANA repository objects and packages could not be 
   activated, it is best to delete the inactive object version in ABAP in  
   some cases. More information can be found in SAP Note 2633397
