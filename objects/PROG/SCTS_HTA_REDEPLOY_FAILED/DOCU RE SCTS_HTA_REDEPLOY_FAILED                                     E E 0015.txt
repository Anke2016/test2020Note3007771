U1 &PURPOSE&                                                               
AS You can use this program to redeploy the following undeployed (error)   
   objects after the objects used by these error objects were corrected:   
B1 HDI objects                                                             
B1 SAP HANA repository packages/objects                                    
AS If the system detects deployment errors in the deployment of HDI objects
   or SAP HANA repository packages/objects, and these errors existed       
   already before the deployment of HDI objects or packages/objects in the 
   HTA repository (although these objects were not part of the SAP HANA    
   deployment), the system attempts to deploy them retroactively.          
AS This means you must correct the error objects and transport them        
   yourself. All dependent error SAP HANA objects (HDI objects/package     
=  s/objects) are redeployed automatically after the import and are free of
   errors if the deployment is successful.

AS This program is executed automatically using the job                    
   REDEPLOY_FAILED_HANA_OBJECTS (which is scheduled by default) in cases   
   where the situation above applies.

AS To start the program manually, select which object type you want to     
   deploy and choose <LS>Execute</>.

*  Object B uses object A. Object A is modified incompatibly and object B  
   is transported in the old version. After the deployment, object B has   
   errors in the target system. The change to object A is now undone and   
   this change is transported. Only object A is transported, which means   
   that object B is not deployed in the transport and the error remains.   
   Any redeployment of error object would now deploy object B again and    
   hence remove the error.
