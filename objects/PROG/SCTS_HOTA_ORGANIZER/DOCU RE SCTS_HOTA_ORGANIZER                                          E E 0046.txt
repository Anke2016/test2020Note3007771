U2 &FEATURES&                                                              
AS You can use <ZH>SAP HANA Transport for ABAP</> (HTA) to transfer objects
   and packages from the SAP HANA repository to the SAP HANA Transport for 
   ABAP repository (HTA repository) in the ABAP system and add them to a   
   transport request. This action is known as "synchronization". Once      
   released, the transport request can be imported using Transport         
   Management System in the target system. The packages and objects in are 
   created and activated in the SAP HANA repository when imported. This    
   action is known as "deployment". In this way, you can transport even    
   minor changes to SAP HANA objects and packages.                         
AS In most cases, you use SAP HANA Transport for ABAP for ABAP for SAP HANA
   applications. These are ABAP applications based on SAP HANA and for     
   which ABAP objects and SAP HANA objects are transported using Change and
   Transport System in ABAP.                                               
U3 The following applies for synchronization in ABAP development systems:  
*  The texts in the SAP HANA objects are synchronized in the original      
   language of the SAP HANA package by default and can be translated using 
   the regular ABAP translation tool (transaction SE63).                   
U3 The following applies for deployment:                                   
*  Deployment of SAP HANA packages and objects generally takes place       
   automatically after a transport request has beeen imported into the     
   system. If this doesn't happen, you can activate the SAP HANA packages  
   and objects in the target system subsequently. This can happen for      
   example if the settings in SAP HANA stipulate that a package cannot be  
   deployed until the prework has been done (deploy mode P). It might be   
   necessary to redeploy because of errors in other objects or missing     
   settings in SAP HANA.

N1 Specify the name of an SAP HANA repository package as a selection       
   criterion or select a package using the input help (F4).                
/  Note how the entry should be spelled. The system is case sensitive.     
   Specify the package name as it is written in the SAP HANA repository.   
   You can use "*" as a wildcard character.                                
/  If you want to include the subpackages of the package in the search,    
   select <LS>Subpackages too</>. Alternatively, you can use "*" as a      
   wildcard after the full package name.                                   
N1 Choose <LS>Execute</>.
